# Personal Developer Portfolio 🚀

[![Site preview](/public/assets/thumbnail.png)](https://ibrahimmemon.dev)

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a Software Engineer and UI/UX Designer. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). It not only provides a visually appealing representation of my work but also ensures optimal performance. View the [live site](https://ibrahimmemon.dev).

# Features 🎉

The whole [portfolio](https://ibrahimmemon.dev) is a React-based single page app built with Next.js in TypeScript, using only statically generated pages.

# Fonts ✍🏻

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins), a custom Google Font with multiple weights (300-900).

# Project images 🖼️

All project images live under `public/projects` and are referenced in the `Projects.tsx` component. The assets folder contains all icons, images, and other media files used throughout the portfolio.

# ✨ Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/figma-portfolio.git

cd figma-portfolio/

npm i

npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

# 🚚 Deployment

Every branch or Pull Request is automatically deployed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with their GitHub integration, where the `main` branch is automatically aliased to [ibrahimmemon.dev](https://ibrahimmemon.dev). A link to a preview deployment will appear under each Pull Request.
